  This repository contains the object attribute dataset for the paper "SynaNet: A Semantic Guided Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion Framework for Object Attribute Recognition with Visual-Tactile-Textual Pre-Alignment". We propose a novel method that utilizes large language models to generate sentence-level attribute descriptions for objects. This manuscript is currently under review at the Knowledge-based Systems journal.

  Upon acceptance of the paper, we will release all datasets used, following the open access policy of KBS. This includes the multi-attribute datasets OBJECTFOLDER-REAL, OBJECTFOLDER-2.0, TACQUAD, and the single material recognition dataset TAG.
