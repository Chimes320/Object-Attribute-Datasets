# Object-Attribute-Datasets
GreetingsÔºÅ
This repository contains the object attribute dataset for the paper "SynaNet: A Semantic Guided Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion Framework for Object Attribute Recognition with Visual-Tactile-Textual Pre-Alignment". We propose a novel method that utilizes large language models to generate sentence-level attribute descriptions for objects. This manuscript is currently under review at the Information Fusion journal.

Upon acceptance of the paper, we will release all datasets used, following the open access policy of INFFUS. This includes the multi-attribute datasets OBJECTFOLDER-REAL, OBJECTFOLDER-2.0, TACQUAD, and the single material recognition dataset TAG.
